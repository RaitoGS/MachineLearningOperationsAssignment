Directories and Files
artifacts/: This directory contains all the .pkl files generated during the project. These files are typically used to store intermediate or final results from model training, preprocessing, or other tasks.
individualwork/: This directory contains the individual contributions of each student. It includes:
Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) that document and run the individual work.
Python scripts (*.py) that contain the code for specific applications developed by each student.
compapp.py: This is the main Python script that combines the individual applications into a single cohesive application.
datasets/: This directory stores the datasets used throughout the project. The files in this directory could be in various formats like .csv, .xlsx, or any other format that was used in the project.

To run the compapp.py, ensure that the pkl file paths are correct.

If you wish to contribute to this project, please ensure that your work is organized under the appropriate directory and that your code follows the project's coding standards.
